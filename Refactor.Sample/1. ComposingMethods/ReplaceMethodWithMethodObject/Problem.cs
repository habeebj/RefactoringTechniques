// Problem
// You have a long method in which the local variables are so intertwined that you canâ€™t apply Extract Method.

// Solution
// Transform the method into a separate class so that the local variables become fields of the class. Then you can split the method into several methods within the same class.

// Benefits
// Isolating a long method in its own class allows stopping a method from ballooning in size. This also allows splitting it into submethods within the class, without polluting the original class with utility methods.
// Drawbacks
// Another class is added, increasing the overall complexity of the program.
